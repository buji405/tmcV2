**Description**

tmc-clusters is an app I developed using Typescript and React. It grabs static data and puts it in a table that is searchable and sortable. I used MaterialUI's `TablePagination` for pagination, but the rest of the app I wrote from scratch.

**Challenges**

One of my biggest challeneges was TypseScript errors slowing me down, also I got slowed down a lot in the very beginning by troubleshooting the version of typescript I had installed not vibing with the version of typescript my editior was on. Another challenge was time. I ended up stopping at the same place I did on the previous project, but if I had a few days to do this I would have added in the tests, as well as adding in another row and saving with local storage. Overall I had fun recreating the first project but from scratch. It was nice to flex those css and JS muscles.
